<h3><strong>B-Town Privacy Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Not much legal jargon here, just nice and simple terms about the information collected and used about you in B-Town.</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<h3><strong>The Information We Collect</strong></h3>
<p>We don't collect any information. </p>

<p>Depending on the social media network you use, you should read their privacy policy as B-Town only integrates them.</p>

<p>Your user profile helps you customize your account and share the tours and images you like. Your profile in B-Town includes your username and profile image. Once you log out, that information is deleted and only retreived when you log back in.</p>

<p>Rating are sent anonymously to the server and are only used to establish which tours are most liked. This will allow us to tailor future tours in the preferred style.</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<h3><strong>How We Use and Disclose Your Information</strong></h3>

<p>Quite simply, we don't disclose any information. B-Town only uses your profile name and picture to allow you to see you have logged in with certain social media.</p>
<p>The profile is used to grant permission to the tours data. The tour data is saved and updated when new tours become available.</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>

<h3><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></h3>

<p>As B-Town develops, we may decide to revise this privacy policy from time to time. The most current version will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="https://carcmedev.github.io/btown/privacy">privacy</a>, and older versions are available upon request. If we make changes that we think will substantially alter your rights, we will notify you by posting a notice on our website. You agree to accept any changes or revisions to this privacy policy by continuing to use B-Town.</p>
<p>&nbsp</p>
